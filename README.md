# Reggie_Linear_Regression

*This project is a part of Codecademy's Data Science Career Path*

Reggie is a mad scientist who has been hired by the local fast food joint to build their newest ball pit in the play area. As such, he is working on researching the bounciness of different balls so as to optimize the pit. He is running an experiment to bounce different sizes of bouncy balls, and then fitting lines to the data points he records. He has heard of linear regression, but needs your help to implement a version of linear regression in Python.

We will use loops, lists, and arithmetic to create a function that will find a line of best fit when given a set of data.
